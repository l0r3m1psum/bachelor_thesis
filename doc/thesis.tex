\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

(da scrivere alla fine)

\subsection{Context}\label{sec:context}
% Short description of context

Firefighting in forests is a complex activity due to the limited availability of
means and resources. Therefore the intervention strategy have to consider the
possible evolution of the fire to make the best use of what is available.

\subsection{Motivations}\label{sec:motivations}
% Motivation for what we want to do

A mathematical model for wildfires was developed by the university of Tor
Vergata, to aid firefighters. The original implementation was made in Microsoft
Excel\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, which is fine for prototyping but not
suitable for large scale simulations.
% \texttrademark

So a more serious implementation was needed, also an easier user interface was
needed.

\iffalse
Describe what is missing and instead would be useful to have\dots Non ne ho la
minima idea. Also Modelica did not made the cut.

\subsection{Contributions}\label{sec:contrib}

%  Describe here your contributions, namely the missing items identified in the motivations.
I have implemented from scrath the simulator, the user interface will be
implemented by others.

\subsection{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

% Describe here the state of the art (e.g., algorithms and tools  available). 
For each paper/tool explain what you do that it is not already available
(killing). Again no clue\dots

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

% Put in this section all the background knowledge needed to understand what you did.
The simulator was implemented in C11 using the OpenMP compiler extension.
Because the server used had a Linux based operating system on it the C standard
library and the POSIX interfaces were used to comunicate with it\footnote{To
make it highly portable}. OpenMP was chosen as the threading interface, instead
of the C11 one or the POSIX one, because of it's semplicity of use and beacuse
the model was trivially parallelizable.

A SQL database (Postgresql) was chosen to integrate all the different data
sources and to handle the concurrency. But the simulator inputs and outputs CSV
files. This format was chosen due to its simplicity and the simplicity of the
data read and written from and to disk. Another important factor was the wide
support that this format has.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
